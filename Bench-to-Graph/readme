The repository contains code and utilities that enable the conversion of popular hardware IP benchmark datasets into graph-based representations. Graph representations offer a powerful and flexible way to capture the structural and functional aspects of hardware IPs, allowing efficient analysis and processing using graph neural networks (GNNs) and other graph-based techniques.

The repository provides a collection of scripts and Jupyter notebooks that facilitate the conversion process. These tools allow researchers to transform benchmark datasets, such as ISCAS, MCNC, or IWLS, into graph formats like GraphML or NetworkX. The resulting graph representations capture the interconnections between gates, input/output relationships, and other important properties of the hardware IPs.
