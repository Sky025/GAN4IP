To perform synthesis using Yosys, you can use the following commands in the Yosys command-line interface:

Read the RTL description:

Use the read_verilog command to read in your RTL file. For example:

read_verilog your_rtl_file.v
Replace your_rtl_file.v with the path to your RTL file.
Perform synthesis:

Use the synth command to perform synthesis. This command applies a series of transformations to convert the RTL into a gate-level representation. For example:

```synth```

Specify the target technology library:

If you want to synthesize the design for a specific target technology, you can use the techmap command to map the synthesized logic to the cells in the target library. For example, if you have a target library file named your_library.lib, you can use the following command:

```techmap -map your_library.lib```

Replace your_library.lib with the path to your target library file.

Perform additional optimizations (optional):

Yosys provides various optimization passes to further improve the synthesized design. You can apply these passes using the opt command. For example:

```opt -full```

This command applies a full set of optimizations to the design.

Write the synthesized netlist:

Use the write_verilog command to output the synthesized gate-level netlist in Verilog format. For example:

```write_verilog synthesized_netlist.v```

Replace synthesized_netlist.v with the desired filename for the synthesized netlist.

Exit Yosys:

When you are finished with the synthesis process, you can use the exit command to exit the Yosys command-line interface. For example:

```exit```

By combining these commands in the correct sequence, you can perform synthesis on your RTL file using Yosys and obtain the synthesized gate-level netlist. Feel free to adjust the commands based on your specific requirements and target technology.
